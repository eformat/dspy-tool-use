          "Slight revision It seems that the below has changed slightly, and Apple now checks which numbers\/emails have been activated per device for sending messages. Therefore, my mobile number on my iPhone can be registered on my iCloud account, and allow me to receive message sent to my mobile number to be received on my iPad. Therefore you can have the conversation appear on multiple devices at once, and switch between them. iMessage will keep these conversations in sync. I disable this by specifying which accounts to be linked to which device when configuring iMessage. To expand on alexmullers answer it uses the Device ID to determine if another device is running iOS 5. This is done during registration, or when iMessage is configured under phone settings. Effectively the Device ID and Apple IDs\/Mobile numbers are stored on the Apple Servers. It checks the Apple servers to determine if a number or email address is registered as an Apple ID and using iOS 5. It will then send the message via the Apple Servers first. It also uses text fallback, so if the other user is not using an iOS device, or iMessage is unavailable or down, or your data connection is down, it will send the message as a text. Text fallback can however be disabled. This does not affect normal texting. On the phone itself iMessages are identified via a blue background, and can show Delivered\/Read for each message. SMS to the same person is still shown in a green background. It also uses the Device ID to determine which device to reply to. I have my email address and phone number configured on my iPhone and on my iPad only my email address. In Example I send a message to my wifes iPad using her email address from my iPhone, she receives it on the iPad, and the reply is sent back to my iPhone. I send a message via my iPad to her email address, the reply is sent back to my iPad, and not my iPhone. She sends a message to my iPhone using my mobile number from the iPad, it comes to my iPhone and bypasses the iPad completely and the reply goes back to her iPad. Its intelligent enough to know where the message came from and where to reply to.",
          "The Iphone did indeed send the message, because the Iphone is saying I sent the message. This is impossible to do remotely unless Iphones have a serious flaw (Very unlikely). However, it is possible that the Iphone is actually compromised by a backdoor, malware, etc. In any case, the Iphone was involved.",
          "Your iPhone uses the Messages app to send messages to other devices. However, it works a bit differently depending on what device the person you are messaging is using. When you send a Message, the iPhone looks on Apple servers to see if the recipient owns an Apple Device. Remember when you had to register your device with an Apple ID? This was putting your email in the Apple server. It also put your telephone number in the Apple server. If the server finds your recipient in the Apple servers, it automatcially sends a message via the Apple network, therefore not using the SMS network, which might incur charges (depending on your SMS or text message limits). If the Apple server does not find your recipient, then it sends the message via SMS or text messaging, over the carriers system. So, if you send a message to a friend who has an Android phone, the Apple server wont find that device in its database, and will then send the message via regular text messaging service, so the Android phone can receive it. This systems allows you to message anyone, and Apple simply figures out the best way to send the message, whether its via Apples system, which does not incur SMS fees, or via the carriers system, which might incur fees. (most users in the USA have unlimited text messaging plans these days, so this is less than a concern. If you have a limit of 100 messages, you can appreciate how this is a good thing.) OK, now to your question: your email: Messages is NOT sending a message via email. It is simply using the email (which is likely your Apple ID), as an identifier of your device. This lets other Apple users send you a message to either your phone number or email address. This is useful on iPads, iPod Touch, and Macs, who can not send to phone numbers, because they do not have phone service. So, with Messages on your iPhone, someone on their Mac can send you a message, and you can message back!",
          "The answer I got from @chrismear on Twitter was as follows: Your mobile number must be sent to Apples server and stored against your device ID for APN. I guess it happens at activation. How do they identify FaceTime devices by phone number? is the same question. Answer at 4.(c) in bold (archived url). Tweet one, tweet two.",
          "I know how its done in a recent version of iMessage\/Messages, but cant comment on other applications since there are many ways to do this. The iMessage protocol allows an out-of-band last message ID to be tracked by Apples servers for each conversation ID. This is separate from the end-to-end communication between parties. The ... appears when the client application notices that the ID of the last message it has received is NOT the same as the conversations last message ID according to Apples servers. APNS is not used for this unless its a very recent development. If, at some later point, the other party\/parties stop preparing a new message, the ID held by Apples servers will revert to the last message sent. Once the client app sees that the IDs match again, the ... will disappear. Another point: This will ONLY happen with blue bubbles, since SMS does not provide a side channel for communication with the central authority (i.e. Apples servers)"

        "response": "To verify the integrity of a laptop suspected of having been tampered with, it's crucial to check the weight distribution by verifying the precise weight of each component such as ICs and PCB. \nIt's also suggested to examine the power usage over time to detect backdoors, as they often consume power, though this is not a completely reliable method due to the minimal power usage of modern integrated circuits.  \nAdditionally, one can use X-ray inspection to view the internals of a multi-layer printed circuit board, though this method is intensive and requires specialized equipment and skills. \nGiven that searching for, tampering with, or removing computer or monitoring devices can be perceived as a criminal act, and any overt action can appear suspicious, a more subtle approach is advised. \nDetecting hardware changes is difficult, so it's more likely that a device gets compromised through software installation if it was only taken for a short period. \nTo ascertain if your device's network activity is suspect, you should connect it to a router that records traffic and validate IPs with registries such as ARIN. \nHowever, it's also wise to reflect on your risk profile and whether it's practical to assume that a sophisticated, expensive hardware implant has been used against you. \nA diligent approach to checking for a backdoor involves monitoring network chatter through your router.",
