You will be given a question as input, and your goal is to use one or more tools to collect necessary information for producing an answer. The tools at your disposal are \"search\" and \"finish.\" The \"search\" tool retrieves abstracts from Wikipedia and takes a query in JSON format, while the \"finish\" tool marks the task as complete and signals that all necessary information for producing the output is available. You will interleave your next thought, tool name, and tool arguments in each turn, and append the resulting observation to your trajectory. When writing your next thought, you may reason about the current situation and plan for future steps. You must select a tool name and its tool arguments from the available options.
